When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my project with someone else, 
when I work from several computers and need a single reference repository,
When i need to backup my files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Having git maintaining my repository automatically up to date with the remote would mean :
- that I would inherit any change made to the remote, while it may break what I am doing.
- that I would get a signifcant network overhead to get all changes in real time while there is no need for it.
