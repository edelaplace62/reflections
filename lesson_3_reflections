When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share my project with someone else, 
when I work from several computers and need a single reference repository,
When i need to backup my files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Having git maintaining my repository automatically up to date with the remote would mean :
- that I would inherit any change made to the remote, while it may break what I am doing.
- that I would get a signifcant network overhead to get all changes in real time while there is no need for it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is to copy a github repository in my own github space, while keeping a link to tehcopied repository. Is used when  I need to derive a projetc from an existing project on github, allows to work on the new project without pushing my chnages to teh original project.
clone is to copy a repository (from a local repository or from a github repository). Is used whenever I want to woek locally on a remote project, or start from an existing local prohect without any intention to push baxk my changes to the original project.
branch is to create a new line of colmmits within a depository. Is used when i need to maintain several versions of the sa e project for some time.
