What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The .git folder is created.
Else git wouldn't know where is the root folder of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The working directory is a physical folder holding files.
The stating area is a list of files from that directory. It is only a list and this list does not necessary references all the files of the working directory;
The repository holds the history of commits, the succession of snapshots of the staging area.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Before doing the commit you can make sure that all the modifications of the files in the staging are targeting the same objective = logical change (ie add a feature, fix a bug, etc..).
